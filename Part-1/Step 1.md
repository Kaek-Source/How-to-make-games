In this tutorial on how to make a games. We will be using unity and Visual Studio Code for coding in C#.

Unity uses C# and that's easy to learn and similar to javascript. And even unity supports javascript too

<Strong>Advantage of Unity:</Strong>

‚Ä¢ Graphics:

  ‚Ä¢ The high quality audio and visual effects are supported by the engine that eases the game development. The visuals are adaptable on every screen and device without any distortion or compromise with the image quality.

‚Ä¢ Documentation:

  ‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs a must have. The novice developers need the easy-to-understand documentation that‚Äôs provided in detail by the Unity engine. The detailed documentation includes the explanation of every small topic.
