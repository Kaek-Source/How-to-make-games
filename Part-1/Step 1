Hi there 👋🏻,

In this tutorial on how to make a games. We will be using unity and Visual Studio Code for coding in C#.

Unity uses C# and that's easy to learn and similar to javascript. And even unity supports javascript too

𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗨𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆:

• Platforms support:
  • The engine is highly preferred for its extended support to 27 platforms. The app developed and deployed can be easily shared between PC, web and mobile platforms. 
• Graphics:
  • The high quality audio and visual effects are supported by the engine that eases the game development. The visuals are adaptable on every screen and device without any distortion or compromise with the image quality.
• Documentation;
  • It’s a must have. The novice developers need the easy-to-understand documentation that’s provided in detail by the Unity engine. The detailed documentation includes the explanation of every small topic.
  • https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityManual.html
• Debugging:
  • The debugging and tweaking is amazingly easier with Unity game development because all the game variables are displayed during gameplay, which in turn allow the developers to debug the process at runtime.
